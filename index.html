                        <p class="ps-4">As a Human Resources Manager, my goal is to use my strong
                            interpersonal and communication skills to support the
                            organization's HR functions effectively. I have a solid foundation in
                            HR principles, including labor law policies, which are the rules
                            related to employees and how they are treated. I also have
                            knowledge in payroll, which involves paying employees and keeping
                            track of their earnings, as well as benefits and compensation,
                            meaning I understand how employees are rewarded for their work.
                            I'm skilled in conflict resolution, which means I can help people at
                            work get along when they have disagreements. I'm also
                            knowledgeable in employee development, which means I can help
                            employees learn and grow in their careers. I am excited to keep
                            learning and growing in the HR field and contribute to the success of
                            the organization through my dedication, adaptability, and
                            commitment to fostering a productive and harmonious workplace.</p>
